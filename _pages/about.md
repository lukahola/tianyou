I am a PhD student (2024--Present) from University of Nottingham with interests in Continuum Robotics, Sensor Fusion, Computer Vision and Robotics Navigation. I'm conducting autonoumous navigation for continuum robots under supervision of [Dr. Xin Dong](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/people/xin.dong) and [Prof. Dragos Anxite](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/people/dragos.axinte). I earned my M.Eng (2021-2024) and B.Eng (2017-2021) from the School of Instrumentation Science and Technology, [Beihang University (BUAA)](https://buaa.edu.cn) under supervision of [Prof. Zhenzhong Wei](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/info/1090/2071.htm).

Education
======
* **Ph.D in Manufacturing Engineering, University of Nottingham** *2024.07--Present*
 
* **M.S. in Instrumentation Science and Technology, Beihang University(BUAA)** *2021.09--2024.01*

* **B.S. in Instrumentation Science and Technology, Beihang University(BUAA)** *2017.09--2021.07*


Experience
======
* **Sensor Fusion for Continuum Robots Autonomous Navigation** *2024.07--Present*
  *Python, ROS, LabVIEW* Individual Project with lab support.

* **6-DoF Pose Estimation and Stereo Depth Estimation** *2021.09--2023.09*

  *Python, PyTorch* Laboratory Project
  * Proposed a novel approach introducing depth information to support surface normals for 6D pose estimation because it integrates 3D scale information and directly suggests objects’ positions in the scene. Reached 95.79% in ADD(-S) 0.1d on the LineMOD dataset, outperforming the baseline (GDR-Net) at 93.7%.
  * Established a non-ideal binocular stereo measurement system and built a measurement error model to instruct depth estimation. Introduced image super-resolution method to key points extraction and matching tasks, which resolves the feature-matching problem of binocular images in different scales.



* **Multi-view Images Features Extraction and Reconstruction** *2020.03--2021.06*
 
  *Python, PyTorch* Individual Project
  * Extracted essential aeroplane structures from single RGB images and reconstructed the structures from three views. Inspired by human pose estimation, the aeroplanes’ critical structures are regarded as human skeletons and annotated in the way of human pose estimation. In the reconstruction process, multiple view geometry was applied in features fusion and got an error at 1.469% in a novel-defined Mean Per
Structure Position Error(MPSPE).
